Lab4: Create a ReplicationController

$ vim ReplicationController.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: project1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    project: lab4
    service: web
    version: "0.1"
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        project: lab4
        service: web
        version: "0.1"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
	  
	  
:wq (save and exit) 


$ kubectl apply -f ReplicationController.yaml

$ kubectl get rc -n project1

NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx   2         2         2       70s


$ kubectl get pod -n project1

NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-cwg8s   1/1     Running   0          103s
nginx-jvvsg   1/1     Running   0          103s


It shows we have two pods up and running. As described previously, ReplicationController
manages all the pods matching the selector. If we create a pod with the same label
manually, in theory, it should match the pod selector of the RC we just created. Let's try it
out:


$ vim self-create-pod.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: our-nginx
  namespace: project1
  labels:
    project: lab3
    service: web
    version: "0.1"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
	
:wq (save and exit) 


$ kubectl create -f self-create-pod.yaml ; kubectl get pod -n project1
pod/our-nginx created
NAME          READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-cwg8s   1/1     Running       0          6m24s
nginx-jvvsg   1/1     Running       0          6m24s
our-nginx     0/1     Terminating   0          0s


It's scheduled, and ReplicationController catches it. The amount of pods becomes three,
which exceeds our desired count. The pod is eventually killed:


If we want to scale on demand, we could simply use kubectl command to update the spec. 

$ kubectl get rc -n project1

NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx   2         2         2       8m38s


change replica count from 2 to 5, default system editor will pop out.

$ kubectl edit rc/nginx -n project1


$ kubectl get rc -n project1

NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx   5         5         5       10m


$ kubectl get pod -n project1 

NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-47z4n   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-8p9m8   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-cwg8s   1/1     Running   0          9m52s
nginx-fp2bj   1/1     Running   0          7s
nginx-jvvsg   1/1     Running   0          9m52s


$ kubectl describe rc nginx -n project1


$ kubectl delete rc nginx -n project1

$ kubectl get pod -n project1
